 Introduction
The Alumni Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to enhance interaction and engagement among alumni, current students, and administrators. In educational institutions, maintaining a strong connection between alumni and the academic community is crucial for several reasons, including networking opportunities, mentorship, job placements, and event participation. This system addresses these needs by providing a dedicated platform that offers various functionalities tailored to each user group.

With this system, alumni can easily manage their profiles, stay updated on job opportunities, and participate in events organized by the institution or fellow alumni. For current students, the platform provides access to a wealth of resources, including available job postings and events, fostering a supportive environment for their career development.

Administrators are equipped with tools to manage alumni records, track participation in events, and facilitate job postings, ensuring that the community remains vibrant and connected. By leveraging file-based data storage, the application ensures data persistence and facilitates seamless updates, making it reliable and efficient.

Overall, the Alumni Management System not only enhances the connectivity and collaboration among alumni and students but also contributes to building a strong and supportive network that benefits all parties involved. By embracing modern programming practices and user-centered design, this project aims to create a lasting impact on the academic community and beyond.
